# Asthma Predictions by Census Tract
### Xiang Xiang Fang and Neta Friedberg

#### Our app asks for a Baltimore City address and gives the probability that someone living at that address has asthma.
#### Our project is based on the Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition (BTEC) & JHU report, which found areas in Baltimore city that are in greatest need of transit improvements, based on four indicator groups: transit, health, social vulnerability, and air pollution.
#### The full report can be found here:
