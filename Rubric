The project is to create a web app based on your research or interests that performs a prediction algorithm or some other non-trivial data calculation. The prediction algorithm can be based on any model (though should be more complex than straight arithmetic, like a BMI calculator). In addition, your readme.md file in your github repo should be a brief writeup of your project (no more than a page if your print it up). You will give a brief presentation screencast of your app. This will be no more than 5 minutes (points deducted if it's longer).

The project directory in your github classroom repo will include at least 3 files. First, the necessary files for your web app to run. In a readme file, describe the structure and give a live link to the hosted video. The video can be hosted on a video hosting service or a file hosting service (Gdrive, onedrive, box, dropbox, ...).

You may work in a team of no more than 5 students. If on a team, each person's contribution must be delineated in the project readme and all 5 team mumbers must separately submit the assignment, including their own video.

Project grading rubric

Web  app details [0, 1]
* Does the app run?
* Does the app take data input?
* Does the un calculations and put out data output?
* Is the app documented so that users know how to use the app?

Project details [0, 1]
* Does the algorithm do some non-trivial data processing or analysis?
* Does the algorthm have some display, graphics or output depending on the input?

Quality details (fraction of [0 - 1] scale)
* Novelty
* Quality of underlying algorithm or method
* Quality of implementation
* Quality of output
* Ease of use
* Documentation

Presentation [0, 1], 5 minute video
* Clarity of presentation
* Stayed within the time limit
* Described the scientific background?
* Described the functioning of the app

Github submission [0, 1]
* Does the github submission have a readme describing the app?
* Does the readme accurately describe the app and link to the documentation (may be in the app itself)?
* Is the code for the app included?
* Is there an example to run the app?
* Does the app run locally? 
* Does the readme accurately describe the system / library requirements of the app?
